# Climate Bias 

This project explores American confirmation bias in climate change by analyzing the relationship between temperature, Twitter
activity, and state political affiliation. I initially expected there to be an increase in twitter content (related to climate change)
in Republican-leaning states in cold weather and a decrease during warm weather.
