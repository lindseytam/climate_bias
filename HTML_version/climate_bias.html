<h1>It's cold outside. <br> Therefore, Climate Change isn't real.</h1>
<h2>Analayzing the relationship between weather and Climate Change related tweets.</h2>
<dt-byline></dt-byline>
<p>This project observes confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek information 
  that supports preexisting beliefs. Specifically, I am looking at how weather trends 
  and political leanings impact how often climate change is mentioned in 
  social media, specifically Twitter. Understanding confirmation bias, especially 
  within our country and in regards to a relevant topic, sheds insight on how bias 
  impacts interpretation of information. In addition to looking at state trends, I will also be looking
  into cities. Comparing the relationship between city and state trends can be interesting,
  especially in cases where the political leaning of the two differ.
  My hypothesis expects that Democratic-leaning 
  states and cities will tweet about climate change more during warm weather while Republican-leaning 
  states and cities will tweet about climate change more during cool weather.</p>

<h2>National Trends</h2>
<p> National political affiliation was gauged using the result of the 2016 Presidential election. Arguably, the election results of a single year is not neccessarily the strongest indication of political prefernce.
  However, I believe it strongly reflects public opinion on the topic of climate change. 
  The issue of climate change has become increasingly controversial over the years. Furthermore, climate change 
  was a major point of contention between the two major political parties. Therefore, 
  I believe using the reults of the 2016 presidential elections reflects a general attitude towards this topic.
  Of course, stance on climate change is not the only factor that caused a state to vote for a 
  particular candidate or political party, but 
  considering the topic was heavily discussed in the election, it seems appropriate to make this assumption.</p>

  <p>The graph below indicates the 
    proportion of votes for each candidate in 5 political parties<dt-fn> Of course, there were more than 5 political parties competing 
        in the election, but these were the five major parties. Gaps in the graph are intentional and reflect votes 
        that were for political parties outside of the five observed.</dt-fn>.  One can clearly see that the two major parties were
    Democrats and Republicans. Therefore, political leaning will be gauged on how strong a state leans toward the
    Democratic or Republic party.</p>
  <img class=l-body src=img/politic.png >
  <p>Similar to the visualization above, the graph to the left is a map that displays political 
    preference by state, with blues 
    representing support for the Democratic party and the reds representing support for the 
    Republican party. However, unlike the visualization above, this graph more clearly displays the strength of 
    political leaning<dt-fn>Characterizing strength of political preference was calculated using z-scores. 
        Z-scores are values that represent how close data is to the mean, with low z scores indicating values 
        that are close to the mean and high z scores indicating values farther away from the mean.
        Political leaning was strong when the absolute value of the z-score was above 1.</dt-fn>, 
        as expressed through color opacity, with darker colors having strong support and lighter 
    colors having weaker support. 
    </p>
  <img class=l-body src=img/map.png >
  <p>An interesting realization that emerged as a result of these visualizations is understanding state 
      preference can be drastically different than city preference. Initially, I wanted to simply look 
      at the voting preference of each capital as an indicator of state 
      preference because I believed that the capital would be a strong representation of the state. 
      I quickly realized that was not the case with all states. Therefore, 
      when looking into state trends, I tried choosing large cities (which also corresponds to more 
      interesting twitter trends and more thorough weather information) that had varied political preferences.</p>
      <img class=l-body src=img/heatmap.png >
  <p>The visualization above is a heatmap comparing how frquently a climate change related key words <dt-fn>climate change, global warming, warming,
      climate, carbon dioxide, co2, pollution, air quality, climate crisis, #climatedenial, #climateemergency,
      climate denial, #climateaction, climate science, drought, and water level</dt-fn> is used in
      each state. The annotated values<dt-fn>All values in 'normalized tweet count by hour' were rounded by 2. Because of this, some of the 0 values
          are not neccessarily 0, but are very small. <br> <br> Also, the term 'pollutionair quality' was a typo; therefore, it is expected that
          all values are zero. </dt-fn> are 'normalized tweet count by hour'. <dt-fn>The value that corresponds 
          to how many tweets containing the keyword are created, on average, for any given hour. It is calculated by dividing all climate change related tweets by the number of hours observed</dt-fn></p>
      <p>California generates the most climate change related tweets, with the most common word used being climate. 
      Climate is also used frquently in New York. In fact, after California, New York and Texas tweet about climate change
      the second and third most. </p>
      <p>I was very surprised that there were so few results for hashtags terms <dt-fn> #climatedenial, #climateemergency </dt-fn>. When looking
      at climate change tweets online, these terms came up alot so it is surprising that almost all states have a value
      of 0 (or close to) for these terms.</p>
  
  <h2>Alaska</h2>
  <p>Alaska has a strong Republican leaning; under the hypothesis, it is expcted that climate change related tweets occur more
    in cold weather.</p>
    <p>Alaska was chosen for two major reasons. Firstly, it is has a strong Republican leaning, and secondly it's climate is one
        of the most impacted by climate change. Therefore, I expected it to have a very strong response to this issue. Ultimately, this did not end up 
        being the case.</p>
    <img class=l-body src=img/AK.png >
    <p>
        One of the highest tweet counts occurred in December 7, 2017 in response to extreme snowfall rates (10 inches per hour!). 
        This supports the hypoethsis that Alaska tweets about climate change more in cooler weather.
      </p>
      <p>
          For December 28, 2017, the spike in tweet count is likely attributed to President Trump's 
          Twitter comment<dt-fn><img  width=500px src=img/trump.png ></dt-fn> regarding climate change. We will see that this tweet ignites a strong response in places beyond Alaska.
        </p>
    <img class=l-body src=img/AK_Overall_dailymax.png >
    <p>The scatterplot above show the relationship between tweet count and temperature extremes. 
      The visualizations are seperated by daily temoperature minimum and daily temperature maximum,
      though there is no a significant difference between the two. Also, the seasonal differences<dt-fn>
        <img width=300px src=img/AK_Spring_dailymax.png >
        <img width=300px src=img/AK_Summer_dailymax.png >
        <img width=300px src=img/AK_Fall_dailymax.png >
        <img width=300px src=img/AK_Winter_dailymax.png ></dt-fn> do not seem significant. If the hypothesis were true,
        we would probably have expected it to occur more during the winter.</p>
  
      <img class=l-body src=img/AK_wordfreq.png >
      <p>
      The bar graph shows which key words people are using the most in their tweets. In this case, climate seems to be the most used word. </p>
      <p>In all, there is no clear relationship between weather trends and twitter counts. If anything, twitter counts seem to be more related
      to national events rather than the weather.</p>
      <h2>Juneau, Alaska</h2>
      <p>Though Alaska is strongly Republican, Juneau has a history of being Democratic leaning. 
          In the last election, the Republican candidate recieved a majority vote of 52.8 as compared 
          to the Democratic votes of 35.1%. If the hypothesis were true, we would expect to see more tweets in warmer weather.</p>
          <p>Recall that the spikes in December are from the extreme snowfall and President Trump's tweet. The small spike in Septmber 20, 2019 was likely caused by a 
            global climate change protest that took place 3 days before the UN Summit. Besides these 3 events, I cannot explain the other spikes in tweet count.
          </p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Juneau.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Juneau_Overall_dailymax.png >
          
          <p>Based on scatterplot information, the relationship between tweet count and seasonality<dt-fn>
              <img width=300px src=img/Juneau_Spring_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Juneau_Summer_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Juneau_Fall_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Juneau_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn> is very weak. 
              There does not seem to be a significant relationship between weather and tweet count.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Juneau_wordfreq.png >
          <p>The proportion of word frequency is nearly equal to Alaska's overall word frequency. This is interesting, considering the state and the city
            have different political leanings.
          </p>
    <p></p>
      <h2>Fairbanks, Alaska</h2>
      <p>Similar to Alaska, Fairbanks is Republican leaningm with 51.4% voting for the Republican candidate and 
          36.6% voting for the Democratic candidate. For this city, there are few climate change related tweets. The largest spike occurs
        when snowfall rates were extreme, but everything else seems consistent.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Fairbanks.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Fairbanks_Overall_dailymax.png >
          
          <p>Since there are so few tweets, finding any trend would be inconclusive. Overall, there seems to be a very weak relationship between 
            season<dt-fn>
                <img width=300px src=img/Fairbanks_Spring_dailymax.png >
                <img width=300px src=img/Fairbanks_Summer_dailymax.png >
                <img width=300px src=img/Fairbanks_Fall_dailymax.png >
                <img width=300px src=img/Fairbanks_Winter_dailymax.png >
            </dt-fn> and tweet count.
          </p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Fairbanks_wordfreq.png >
          <p>Unlike Alaska and Juneau, Fairbanks' most frequently used word is warming.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Kodiak, Alaska</h2>
      <p>Kodiak was chosen, because historically it has been slightly left leaning. In the
          2016 presidential election, Kodiak actually had 41.5% support for the Democratic party and 45.4% for the 
          Republican party. I believed this could shed interesting results regarding weather and climate change related
          tweets. However, that proved to not be the case.</p>
          <p>In hindsight, this was not an effective city to look it. Based on the two instance of climate chnage related
              tweets, it is not obvious of there is any weather relationship. Interestingly, the two tweet instances both occured
              in the winter, with no tweets in any other season. However, given the extremely limited sample size,
              all results drawn are inconclusive.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Kodiak.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Kodiak_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>The season trends <dt-fn>
              <img width=300px src=img/Kodiak_Spring_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Kodiak_Summer_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Kodiak_Fall_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Kodiak_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn> hardly reveal anything.</p>
          
          <p>The tweet count is too small to make any conclusion regarding seasonality</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Kodiak_wordfreq.png >
          <p>Out of the two tweets created, both were about the climate. This should be interpreted with a grain a salt.
            The term climate is very general and has a high bayes error.
          </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>California</h2>
      <p>California was chosen because it is strongly Democratic and tweets about climate change the most, as seen by the earlier heatmap.</p>
      
         <img class=l-body src=img/CA.png >
         <p>Many of the spikes in tweet count seem to be due to national events as opposed to weather trends. The December spike was probably in response 
           to President Trump's tweet. On September 13, 2018, the California Climate Talks were occurring, which would explain the second spike. The final spike 
           towards the end of 2019 was likely in response to the global climate change protest.

         </p>
         <p>Even though California has the highest number of climate change tweets, all spikes can be explained by national events. If the hypothesis were true, 
           there would be more spikes during warmer weather, but that was not the case.
         </p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/CA_Overall_dailymax.png >
      
          <p>There does not seem to be a seasonal variation in tweet counts.<dt-fn>

              <img width=300px src=img/CA_Spring_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/CA_Summer_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/CA_Fall_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/CA_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn>
          </p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/CA_wordfreq.png >
          <p>The term climate seems to be the most frequently used</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Los Angeles, California</h2>
      <p>Los Angeles is strongly Democratic, with 71.8% voting for the Democratic candidate, 
          and 22.4% voting for the Republican candidate. Therefore, we would expect spikes in tweet count tend to occur during warmer weather.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Los_Angeles.png >
          <p>Interestingly, in July through August 2018, there seems to be some relationship between temperature and tweet count. 
              There were two extremely hot days had a spike in tweeet count. However, it is also possible that this was caused by chance.</p>
        
      <p>Nearly every major spike in tweet count is accounted for<dt-fn>
          December 28, 2017: Donald Trump Tweets about climate change <br>
          September 13, 2018: California Climate Talks <br>
          November 11, 2018: Woolsey Fires <br>
          February 21, 2019: Snows in Hollywood <br>
          March 15, 2019: Global climate change strikes <br>
          September 20, 2019: Climate change strike 3 days before UN summit <br>
           November 1, 2019: Maria Fires </dt-fn> 
           in terms of national events. Unlike other cities thus far, 
      Los Angeles has been impacted by several natural disasters (fires), which resulted in more spikes than other
      cities.</p>
      <img class=l-body src=img/Los_Angeles_Overall_dailymax.png >
    <p>Like California, Los Angeles does not have a significant seasonal variation<dt-fn>
        <img width=300px src=img/Los_Angeles_Spring_dailymax.png >
        <img width=300px src=img/Los_Angeles_Summer_dailymax.png >

        <img width=300px src=img/Los_Angeles_Winter_dailymax.png >
    </dt-fn>.</p>

          <img class=l-body src=img/Los_Angeles_wordfreq.png >
    <p></p>
    <h2>Sacramento, California</h2>
      <p>Sacremento is the capital of California and shares a similar Democratic political. In the 2016 election, 
          58% of votes were for the Democratic candidate and 33.8% were for the Republican candidate.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Sacramento.png >
          <p>Some of the major spikes in tweet count can be attributed to national events.<dt-fn>
            August 27, 2018: Sacramento Valley Region Report<br>

              February 14, 2019: Global Climate change strike<br>
              
              September 20, 2019: Climate change strike 3 days before UN summit</dt-fn></p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Sacramento_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>Climate change related tweets increase slightly around the fall<dt-fn> 
            <img width=300px src=img/Sacramento_Spring_dailymax.png >
            <img width=300px src=img/Sacramento_Summer_dailymax.png >
            <img width=300px src=img/Sacramento_Fall_dailymax.png >
            <img width=300px src=img/Sacramento_Winter_dailymax.png ></dt-fn> but I believe this is because many of the
              national events coincidentally occurred during this time.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Sacramento_wordfreq.png >
    <p>Once again, it seems like there is no weather correlation. Instead, national events are strongly related
        with increases in tweet count.</p>
    <h2>Berkeley, California</h2>
      <p>Berkeley is strongly Democratic-leaning.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Berkeley.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Berkeley_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>There seems to be slight seasonal variations<dt-fn>
              <img width=300px src=img/Berkeley_Spring_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Berkeley_Summer_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Berkeley_Fall_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/Berkeley_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn> in tweet count. There is a notable increase in tweets in the summer. I imagined that the opposite would be true, since Berkeley is a college town
        and many students leave in the summer.</p>
          
          <img class=l-body src=img/Berkeley_wordfreq.png >
    <p></p>
    <h2>Texas</h2>
      <p>Texas has a slight Republican leaning, so it is expected there will be more tweets in colder weather.</p>
      <p>For this state, cities were chosen based on population size. Unbeknownst to me at the
          time, all of the cities are chose were liberal leaning. In hindight, more Republican leaning cities should have been included.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/TX.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/TX_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>There does not appear to be any seasonal trends. <dt-fn>
              <img width=300px src=img/TX_Spring_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/TX_Summer_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/TX_Fall_dailymax.png >
              <img width=300px src=img/TX_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn></p>
          
          <img class=l-body src=img/TX_wordfreq.png >

    <p>The word frequency of Texas is interesting, as it is different from the other observed cities and states.</p>
    <h2>Dallas, Texas</h2>
      <p>Dallas is liberal leaning with 60.2% of the people voting for the Democrat candiate in 
          the last presidential election and 34.3% voting for the Republican candidate.</p>
          <p>There is a slight gap in weather data in late 2017. This is attributed to maintenance being done on the weather station.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Dallas.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Dallas_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>There is no obvious seasonal trend <dt-fn>

              <img width=300px src=img/Dallas_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn> in tweet count.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Dallas_wordfreq.png >
    <p></p>

    <h2>Houston, Texas</h2>
      <p>Unlike Texas, Houston's leanings are more liberal with 54% voting Democrat and 41.6% voting Republican.</p>
      <p>Similar to Dallas, some weather data is missing due to weather station maintenance.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/Houston.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/Houston_Overall_dailymax.png >

              <img width=300px src=img/Houston_Winter_dailymax.png >

          <img class=l-body src=img/Houston_wordfreq.png >
    <p></p>

    <h2>San Antonio, Texas</h2>
      <p>Unlike Texas, San Antonio voted 53.7% Democrat and 40.4% voted Republican in the last presidential election.</p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/San_Antonio.png >
          <img class=l-body src=img/San_Antonio_Overall_dailymax.png >
          <p>There seems to be some seasonal<dt-fn>

              <img width=300px  src=img/San_Antonio_Winter_dailymax.png >
          </dt-fn> variations in tweet count.</p>
          
          <img class=l-body src=img/San_Antonio_wordfreq.png >
    <p>Thus far, all the major cities seem to have climate as the most used word. This is interesting, because the most used word in the state is c02.</p>
    <h2>Massachusetts</h2>
      <p>Massachusetts has a weak Democratic leaning</p>

    <h2>Weather Data</h2>
    <p><a href='https://https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html'>Weather data</a> came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and included temperature minimums 
        and maximums for all state stations everyday in the last 2 years. To determine an area's weather, I chose the 
        closest weather station. I am unsure how close the weather station is to the location itself. For instance, if the station 
        was in Boston, I do not know if it was in the cenetr of Boston, or closer to the city's edge.</p>
    <h2>Political Preference Data</h2>
    <p>Data regarding the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election'>2016 Presidential Election</a> was used to gauage 
      each state's political leanings. This dataset covers the proportion of votes for each of the 5 major political party candidates in each
      coutnty in each state. To generate state proportion, I simply averaged every county within a state. Furthermore, the strength of
      political leaning was also calculated using z scores.</p>
      <h2></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Incorporating precipitation data could have been potentially interesting. The media covers incidences where people cite 
          snow as proof that climate change is not real. Therefore, it could have been interesting to see if that trend plays out
          in social media as well. The reason that I did not pursue this is firstly because NOAA's weather data is somewhat limited
          in terms of precipitation
          and secondly it would be difficult to faciliate comparisons between states, considering not all states have snow. </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <h3>Working with Twitter Data</h3>
  
  <p>An issue that arose when working with Twitter data was managing format type. I was unable to load the files a JSONs;
      instead, they were loaded as a single long string, or set of charactors. Therefore, I spent nearly one week parsing the 
      two years worth (2017-2019) of Twitter data into CSV files. The intial data set included many parameters, such as the number of retweets
      and shares, but the only variables I parsed included date of origin, city, and state. Every single day and every single hour were parsed.
      However, some files ended up getting corrupted, which required normalizing some of the values that will be later discussed.</p>
  <h3>Identifying Key Words</h3>
  
  <p>After transforming the data into an interpreatble format, the goal was to narrow it down to a set
      of tweets that had chnages related to climate change. After looking up popular climate change related tweets
      and hashtags,
      I was able to come up with a list of key words, which included: climate change, global warming, warming,
      climate, carbon dioxide, co2, pollution, air quality, climate crisis, #climatedenial, #climateemergency,
      climate denial, #climateaction, climate science, drought, and water level. I wanted to stay away from words, such as hot or cold, 
      which I thought were too general and could increase the estimation, optimization, and generalization error. 
      Any tweets containing these words were included.</p>
      <p>I am unsure of how much overlap occurred as a result of word choices. For instance, in the case of the
          the key words 'warming' and 'global warming', I am not confident that tweets were not double counted. I struggled with making
          the words generalizable, but also wanted to capture words that were highly specific to climate change. 
          Including the gernealizable words possibly resulted in a higher error</p>

<h3>Normalizing Value</h3>
<p>Though all twitter data was parsed, some time periods became corrupted. I am unsure why this occurred, 
    but I had to develop a way to account for this when interpreting the data. For example, if only 4 hours were 
    accounted for, it would not be fair to compare it to a day when all 24 hours were used. To account for this,
    I normalized tweets by total tweets and by hour. Tweets that were 'normalized by total count' were all climate change
    related tweets divided by total tweets, and this was calculated for every day. Similarly, 'normalized by hour' tweets
    were calculated by dividing all climate change related tweets by the number of hours observed. Even though 'normalized by hour'
    is a better metric than a simple count of tweets, it is still somewhat flawed. We can make an assumption that people
    tweet more duing waking hours. Considering 'normalized by hour' does not take into consideration which hours data was collected,
    we can assume there is some generalization error in this value.</p>
    <p>For all of the graphs, normalized tweet count per hour was used. For instance, a normalized tweet 
        count per hour of .4 in California indicates that, on average, .4 tweets about climate change were generated
        per hour in California. I did not use 'normalized by total count', because they results were harder to interpret. 
        There are hundreds of thousands of tweets on any given day, with climate change related tweets being a small minority.
        Therefore, nearly all 'normalized by total count' tweets had values close to zero.</p>
