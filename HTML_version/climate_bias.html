<h1>It's cold outside. <br> Therefore, Climate Change isn't real.</h1>
<h2>Analayzing the relationship between weather and Climate Change related tweets.</h2>
<dt-byline></dt-byline>
<p>This project observes confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek information 
  that supports preexisting beliefs. Specifically, I am looking at how weather trends 
  and political leanings impact how often climate change is mentioned in 
  social media, specifically Twitter. Understanding confirmation bias, especially 
  within our country and in regards to a relevant topic, sheds insight on how bias 
  impacts interpretation of information. Specifically, I will be comparing California, a liberal leaning state
  , with Texas, a conservative leaning state. I expect that California
   will tweet about climate change more during warm weather while Texas
 will tweet about climate change more during cool weather.</p>

 <p>To gain a better understanding of geographic variations regarding climate change related tweets, one can refer to the visual below.
   This gives a general idea regarding the trends in key terms 

   <dt-fn>
  Key words were used to filter tweets that are related to climate change. After looking up popular climate change related tweets
   and hashtags, I was able to come up with a list of key words, which included: climate change, global warming, warming,
   climate, carbon dioxide, co2, pollution, air quality, climate crisis, #climatedenial, #climateemergency,
   climate denial, #climateaction, climate science, drought, and water level. 
      <br>  <br>
   I wanted to stay away from words, such as hot or cold, 
   which I thought were too general and could increase the amount of noise in the data. I am unsure of how 
   much overlap occurred as a result of word choices. For instance, in the case of the
   the key words 'warming' and 'global warming', I am not confident that tweets were not double counted. I struggled with making
   the words generalizable, but also wanted to capture words that were highly specific to climate change. </dt-fn>

   broken down by state. Dark blue values indicate frequently used words while 
   dark red values indicate less frequently used words. The annotated values in white are the average tweets per hour.
   </p>

 <img class=l-body src=img/heatmap.png >
  <p>For all of the graphs, normalized tweet count per hour 
          <dt-fn> An issue that arose when
           working with Twitter data was managing format type. I was unable to load the files a JSONs;
            instead, they were loaded as a single long string, or set of charactors. Therefore, I spent nearly one week parsing the 
            two years worth (2017-2019) of Twitter data into CSV files. The intial data set included many parameters, such as the number of retweets
            and shares, but the only variables I parsed included date of origin, city, and state. Every single day and every single hour were parsed.
            However, some files ended up getting corrupted, which required normalizing some of the values to reduce bias.
            For example, if only 4 hours were accounted for, it would not be fair to compare it to a day when all 24 hours were used. To account for this,
          I normalized tweets by total tweets and by hour. Tweets that were 'normalized by total count' were all climate change
          related tweets divided by total tweets, and this was calculated for every day. Similarly, 'normalized by hour' tweets
          were calculated by dividing all climate change related tweets by the number of hours observed. Even though 'normalized by hour'
          is a better metric than a simple count of tweets, it is still somewhat flawed. We can make an assumption that people
          tweet more duing waking hours. Considering 'normalized by hour' does not take into consideration which hours data was collected,
          we can assume there is some degree of error in this value.</dt-fn> 

          was used. For instance, a normalized tweet 
            count per hour of .4 in California indicates that, on average, .4 tweets about climate change were generated
            per hour in California.</p>

      <p>I was very surprised that there were so few results for hashtags terms <dt-fn> #climatedenial, #climateemergency </dt-fn>. When looking
      at climate change tweets online, these terms came up alot so it is surprising that almost all states have a value
      of 0 (or close to)
      <dt-fn> Normalized tweet count was rounded by 2.
          Because of this, some of the 0 values are not neccessarily 0, but are very small. Also, the term 'pollutionair quality' was a typo; therefore, it is expected that
        all values are zero. </dt-fn> 
        for these terms.</p>

      <p>Looking across all states, climate seems to be the most frequently used word. 
        It is important to note that climate is not always used in the context of climate change.
        Therefore as we will later see, we cannot make the assumption that using the word climate is the best indication of a state
        having more climate change related tweets. </p>

       <p> Looking at all words, one can see that California generates the most climate change related tweets, with the most common word used being climate. 
      Texas also has a high frequency of climate change related key words, though slightly less than that of California. A simplified graphic containing
       just these two states for comparison can be found below: </p>
      
      <img class=l-body src=img/compare_heatmap.png >

      <p>From here, one can see that California has more slightly tweets for every key word as compared to Texas (except a tie at 'water level'). 
        These small differences may be attributed to population density. California's population almost 40 million is significantly larger than Texas'
        population of almost 30 million. 
      </p>


    <h2>California</h2>
      <p>California was chosen because it is strongly Democratic and tweets about climate change the most, as seen by the earlier heatmap. 
        From the hypothesis, one would expect to see more tweets occur during warmer weather. The warmest periods in California seem to occur around
        August 2018 and 2019, yet there is no significant spike in tweets during these times. In fact, the sharpes spikes actually occur in December and
      late September.</p>
      
         <img class=l-body src=img/CA.png >

         <p>Many of the spikes in tweet count seem to be due to national events as opposed to weather trends. The December spike was likely in response 
           to President Trump's polarizing tweet on climate change<dt-fn><img width=500px src=img/trump.png ></dt-fn>.
           We do not see spikes for every climate change related tweet by President Trump; I believe this particular one illicted such a strong response
           because it was the first one made by him. Once he started consistently tweeting about it, the public reacted less to it. In late September 13, 2018,
          the California Climate Talks were occurring, which would explain the second spike. The final spike 
           towards the end of 2019 was likely in response to the global climate change protest. In late September 2019, there were a series of major 
          international climate change strikes in response to the meeting of United Nations Climate Summit. To be clear, I am not saying that these 
          national events are the sole cause of these spikes, but I believe that they had a strong impact on these trends.
         </p>

          <p>Perhaps disregading time can yield more intresting results. By only looking at temperature<dt-fn>
            For all scatterplot visuals, temperature was calculated using z-scores. A z-score is a measure of how far a value is from the mean, with larger score magnitudes
             being very far from the mean (more extreme) and smaller score magnitudes being much closer to the mean. Meaning, a z-score of 3 is indicative of a very hot day and 
            a z-score value of -3 is an extremely cold day. In this case, 
            the mean is the average from the two years' worth of data. For this specific visual, we are using value of daily maximum, which does not look significantly
            different if we were to use the daily minimum. 
          </dt-fn> 
          and tweet count, one can better visualize the distribution of data. 
          If the hypothesis were false and tweet count is actually independent of temperature, the graphs would be
          symmetric across the horizontal line where temperature z-score equals 0. This appears to be the case for California.</p>
         
          <img class=l-body src=img/CA_Overall_dailymax.png >
          
          <p>Below is a breakdown of how frequently each key word is used in California. Climate is used most often, 
            but recall that this term has a high amount of noise. 
            For instance, people may be using this term in contexts outside of climate change. 
          The term climate change, on the other hand, has much lower noise. Interestingly, the term climate change is the third most used key word.
          I found it fascinating that the use of global warming was less than half of that of climate change. The two key words have the same meaning
          and conotation, so I expected their usage to be more similar. The second most used word was warming. Similar to climate, this word is not always used
          in the context of climate change. This word was included because I believed people were highly likely to shorten global warming to warming, though 
          its hard to verify if this was actually the case. </p>

          <img class=l-body src=img/CA_wordfreq.png >
    
    <p>In conclusion, these visuals seem to disprove the hypothesis that there is a relationship
      between climate change related twitter activity and the weather. Even though California has the highest number of climate change tweets and has 
      a strong stance on this subject, all spikes can be explained by national events and scatterplot data shows no obvious relationship. </p>

      <br>

    <h2>Texas</h2>
      <p>Texas has a conservative leaning, so under the hypothesis, it is expected there will be more tweets in colder weather. From the visual below, 
        the coldest periods occured in December 2018 and 2019, with another major weather dip in Novermber 2019. In terms of quantity of tweets, Texas seemed 
        to fluctuate at around 5 tweets per hour, which is less than that of Califonia at around 10 per hour. Again, this could potentially be the result
        of their differentt population densities.
      </p>
          <img class=l-body src=img/TX.png >
        <p>There does appear to be a twitter increase during extreme weather lows
            for both December 2018 and 2019, but not for Novermber 2019. The December 2018 spike maybe attributed to the same tweet from President Trump but
            I could not find an event that could have caused the other Janurary spike.
            Another major spike was in Septmeber 2019; this was likely caused by the international climate change strikes mentioned in the section above.
           </p>

           <p> The scatterplot below shows an interesting relationship. The density of tweets seems higher in warmer weathers and more scattered
             in cooler weathers. If the hypothesis were true, I would expect to see a higher density when temperature is cooler. </p> 

          <img class=l-body src=img/TX_Overall_dailymax.png >

          <p>It is difficult to evaluate any significant pattern from this visual alone. A possible
            explanation for the variance in cool weather could be the fact that many of the spikes occurred in winter (cooler weather).
          </p>
        
          
          <img class=l-body src=img/TX_wordfreq.png >

    <p>The word frequency of Texas is shares some similarities with California.
      For instance, climate is the most used word. In general, the two seem to share the same most used words, but in varying orders.
      Unlike California, Texas' second most used word was CO2. 
      CO2 is often cited as the number one contributor of climate change, which is why it was included in the list of key words. This was followed
      by warming and climate change.
    </p>
    <p> Comparing the proportion of words between these two states is also interesting. In California, climate has nearly double the frequency of warming 
      (the second most used key word) while the Texas had a less drastic difference (250 count). For both states, climate change is used twice as 
      frequently as global warming. The word drought is used, at almost the same freuency, between the two states.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Weather Data</h2>
    <p><a href='https://https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html'>Weather data</a> came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and included temperature minimums 
        and maximums for all state stations everyday in the last 2 years. To determine an area's weather, I chose the 
        closest weather station. I am unsure how close the weather station is to the location itself. For instance, if the station 
        was in Boston, I do not know if it was in the center of Boston, or closer to the city's edge.</p>
        <p>Incorporating precipitation data could have been potentially interesting. The media covers incidences where people cite 
            snow as proof that climate change is not real. Therefore, it could have been interesting to see if that trend plays out
            in social media as well. The reason that I did not pursue this is firstly because NOAA's weather data is somewhat limited
            in terms of precipitation
            and secondly it would be difficult to faciliate comparisons between states, considering not all states have snow. </p>
    <h2>Political Preference Data</h2>
    <p>Data regarding the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election'>2016 Presidential Election</a> was used to gauage 
      each state's political leanings. This dataset covers the proportion of votes for each of the 5 major political party candidates in each
      county in each state. </p>
